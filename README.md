# SentinelAI: Cloud-Native Intrusion Detection Platform on AWS SageMaker and FastAPI

An AI-powered intrusion detection system leveraging AWS SageMaker, FastAPI, Lambda, and Terraform to classify network threats in real time.

---

## üìå Overview

**SentinelAI** is an end-to-end cloud-native pipeline for detecting intrusions and anomalies in network logs. The system is fully automated, serverless where possible, and leverages modern ML tooling to classify threats with high accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Data Ingestion & Collection**
  - EC2 instances running collection agents and scripts
  - S3 storage of raw logs
  - CloudTrail tracking of API calls
  - Terraform infrastructure provisioning (EC2, VPC, S3)
  - SSH for secure configuration
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD deployment validation

- **Preprocessing & Model Training**
  - Python scripts for data cleaning, scaling, and serialization
  - Random Forest classifier as baseline
  - Deep MLP models in TensorFlow
  - SageMaker for training, evaluation, and artifact storage
  - Step Functions to orchestrate preprocessing workflows
  - Lambda triggers based on S3 events

- **Inference, Monitoring & Notifications**
  - SageMaker Endpoint hosting trained models
  - FastAPI REST interface for real-time predictions
  - CloudWatch metrics and logs
  - Lambda functions for inference orchestration
  - SNS notifications on critical events
  - IAM policies for secure access control

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Ingestion**
   - Raw logs are collected via EC2 collection agents.
   - Logs are stored in S3 and tracked with CloudTrail.
   - Terraform provisions all core infrastructure.

2. **Preprocessing & Training**
   - Lambda triggers preprocessing when new data arrives.
   - Python scripts clean, encode, and scale the data.
   - SageMaker trains Random Forest and deep learning models.
   - Model artifacts are saved in S3.

3. **Inference & Monitoring**
   - SageMaker Endpoint hosts the production model.
   - FastAPI serves a REST API for real-time scoring.
   - CloudWatch tracks usage, latency, and errors.
   - SNS alerts notify stakeholders of critical events.
